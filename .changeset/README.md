# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that
works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to use changesets

### Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
npx changeset
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the bump type (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Versioning

When you're ready to release, run:

```bash
npx changeset version
```

This will:
- Consume all changesets
- Update version numbers
- Update the CHANGELOG

### Publishing

After versioning, publish with:

```bash
npx changeset publish
```

Or simply push to main and let the CI handle it!
